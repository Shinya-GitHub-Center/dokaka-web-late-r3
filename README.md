## GitHub as a Post-Pandemic Survival Wisdom
This is a musician's website, who is eager to utilize GitHub as a Post-Pandemic Survival Wisdom. (GPSW)
I have launched GitHub branch in order to catch up with the lastest IT technology, and I believe that GitHub gonna really be helpful for living after pandemic world.
If you want to know more about me, please review my Wiki in this repository or visit my website.
(You can check out [sample video](https://dokaka.com/about/#sample-video))

## For the next version up
* (FOUND OUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE) : _Study how to stop running CI/CD after editted README.md on the remote repository._
* (NO MOTIVATION TO TRY) : _It seems like `prefers-color-scheme` only reflects system color mode, therefore if toggled by the user, `prefers-color-scheme` can not judge which color is currently being active. I'm gonna read through [here](https://theme-ui.com/color-modes/) and [here](https://www.jscodetips.com/examples/how-to-override-css-prefers-color-scheme-setting) for the next release._
